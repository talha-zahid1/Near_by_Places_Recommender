📍 Nearby Places Recommender (Backend)

Nearby Places Recommender is a backend-only REST API that provides nearby place recommendations based on a user’s current location (latitude & longitude) and selected mood or preference such as food, work, relaxation, or exploration.

The API fetches nearby places using OpenStreetMap-based services and filters the data according to the user’s mood. It is built with Node.js and Express and follows a clean MVC architecture for scalability and maintainability.
